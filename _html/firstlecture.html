          <h2 class="content-head">First Lecture</h2>
          <p>Today the first lectures and seminars began in <a href="http://www.thehagueuniversity.com/">The Hague University of Applied sciences</a>regarding the <a href="http://www.thehagueuniversity.com/bachelor-studies/bachelor-degree-programmes/communication-and-multimedia-design/programme-feature">Communication and Multimedia Design &ndash; User Experience (CMD-UX)</a> course.</p>
          <p>The first Seminar was an Introduction to the principles of &ldquo;UX- Design&rdquo;. From the start it was clear that, the name &ldquo;User Experience Design&rdquo; was a broad term with many definitions to it.</p>
          <p>We stuck to the definition by Hartson &amp; Pyla:</p>
          <p><em>&ldquo;User Experience is the totality of the effect or effects felt by a <strong>user</strong> as a result of interaction with, and the usage <strong>context</strong> of, a <strong>system</strong>, device, or product, including the influence of <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>usefulness</strong>, and <strong>emotional impact</strong> during interaction&rdquo;</em></p>
          <p><em>Hartson &amp; Pyla, &nbsp;2012</em></p>
          <p>We also discussed the path that lead to the existence of this field of study.</p>

          Figure of The History of User Experience
          <p><strong>1940s to 1950s<br />
            </strong>Early computers were incredibly complex to operate so the only&nbsp;users were highly trained engineers. It was all about evaluating if the system was&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;eugh and how long it would&nbsp;function.</p>
          <p><strong>1950s to 1960s<br />
            </strong>Computers began to get smaller&nbsp;and became very slightly less complicated to use.<br />
            There were also ne Inventions that enhanced usability, such as the following new input methods: magnetic tape, punch cards, light guns, and, eventually, keyboards.</p>
          <p>Now the engineers were not the only users anymore.With the invention of programming Languages many people learned how to program and&nbsp;eventually computers were used by both &ldquo;programmers&rdquo; and &ldquo;computer scientists&rdquo;.</p>
          <p><strong>1960s to&nbsp;</strong><strong>1980s<br />
            </strong>Users were no longer trained experts; they were non- specialists</p>
          <p>With these users, it was necessary to determine if a computer would actually be able to <strong>save time</strong>. Evaluators began to focus on <strong>user performance</strong>, which meant they would focus on task&nbsp; completion and the time it took, how many errors occurred, and how difficult it would be to learn how to effectively use a computer.</p>
          <p><strong>1980s to 2000s<br />
            </strong>The GUI interface, pioneered by Xerox and later on used in both Microsoft and Apple products, was a huge step in Usability and visualizing data on a Computer.</p>
          <p>Now anyone was able to use Computer systems &nbsp;with minimal training and support.</p>
          <p><strong>2000s to present (2016)<br />
            </strong>&ldquo;Recently&rdquo; Computers are used for all kinds of things and ease our way of live in many aspects, some maybe:<br />
            Personal computing, social computing, mobile computing, cloud computing, and ERP Systems. These inventions and enhancements have changed how we live, communicate, work and also&nbsp;where and on what Hardware.</p>
          <p>Thus, the emotional side of using computers is paramount. Although Task-based performance are still important we are realizing that using a computer is both cognitive and emotional.</p>
          <p><strong>It is the Experience that really matters!</strong></p>
