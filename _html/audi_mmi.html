          <h2 class="content-head">Audi MMI Board Computer</h2>
          <h2>Car MMI ( Multi Media interface/ Board Computer)</h2>
          <p>The &ldquo;Multi Media Interface&rdquo; (MMI) designed and developed by Audi is the on board computer that administers all the key car functions. Its spectrum of functions includes mobile phone (Bluetooth) options and sound, media, radio and navigation options. Furthermore it visualizes car statistics such as speed , fuel tank/fuel consumption and driving time. These statistics are very essential for the driving experience and are also important to be aware of as user/driver.</p>
          <p>The typical user of this product is 17+ old owns a driver license and has access to a Car (in this case an Audi). However in some cases the user can also be a passenger who is interacting with the device while the driver is driving. The product is designed for the driver himself, which means that the system has to be very easy to interact with and also designed intuitively to enable the user to use it whilst driving the car. Human computer interaction is the main focus of this product, since the buttons and other controls need to be very easy to operate for every driver. It is also important that both right and left handed people can use this system effectively. <br />
            <br />
            Besides the operating aspects of this device the developers had to focus a lot on the visual design of the software, to ensure that the user can understand and process the information on the display &nbsp;in the fastest way possible to be able to drive and interact at the same time.</p>
          <p>This product is interesting to write about, because it contains many different aspects that are essential in user experience. For most of us the &ldquo;MMI&rdquo; or anything similar is a product that we use everyday, and compared to the past the driving experience, enhanced a lot when this product was introduced. But with this product on the market it is up to the User Experience designer to make driving safer by creating a product that is easy to use and does not distract humans from driving but rather make try to make driving safer.</p>
